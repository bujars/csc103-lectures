/* TODO: write a function that reads an integer b (say b < 10), and
 * another integer n, and then prints a string that represents the
 * integer n in base b.  E.g., if b=7 and n=94, your program would
 * output digits "163", as 94 = 1*49 + 6*7 + 3.  ("361" is also ok if
 * you print the least significant digit first).  Or if b=2 and n=7,
 * then you would print "111" since 7 = 1*4 + 1*2 + 1. */
/* TODO: try to do the reverse of the above -- read an integer base b
 * and then a string of base-b digits, and construct the corresponding
 * integer that those digits represent. */
